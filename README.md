# FGR_XAI

This repository contains python code for the machine learning methods applied in Fetal Growth Restriction Diagnosis.  The machine learning algorithms are checked for their best performance improvement with the addition Nuchal Fold.  Correlation between predictors are sought.
It also contains R code for Interpretable Machine Learning, which are Feature Interaction, ALE (Accumulated Local Effect) plot and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations).
